This is a repository that stores most of the pixel art I save that isn't being used for anything, its mostly not sorted (so good luck finding a specific sprite), this is also a repository for storing/experimenting with ideas, or for assets for games I haven't created (Maybe some random sprites for prototyping games)

NOTES:
- most of these sprites are scaled up to be easier to view on github
- this repository is (mostly) for saving my progress as a pixel artist, so I can see how much I've improved, and a place to try out new things

===
Feel free to use any of these sprites, the sprites themselves or as ideas for some of your sprites!
