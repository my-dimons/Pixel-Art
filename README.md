This is a repository that stores most of the pixel art I save that isn't being used for anything, its mostly not sorted (so good luck finding a specific sprite). This is also a repository for experimenting with ideas, or for assets for games I haven't created (Maybe some random sprites for prototyping games)

NOTES:
- most of these sprites are scaled up to be easier to view on github
- ALL sprites in the "Game Assets" folder is scaled to be properly used for games (meaning sprites are NOT SCALED UP)
- this repository is (mostly) for saving my progress as a pixel artist, so I can see how much I've improved, and a place to try out new things


Feel free to use any of these sprites

You can use these sprites anywhere you want, I don't care. These are mostly sprites I use for testing or trying things out. most of these sprites aren't going to be used by me, so they should probably be used by at least someone
